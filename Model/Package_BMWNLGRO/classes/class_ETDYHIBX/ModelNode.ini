Description=The wxApp class represents the application itself. It is used to:\n\n    * set and get application-wide properties;\n    * implement the windowing system message or event loop;\n    * initiate application processing via wxApp::OnInit;\n    * allow default processing of events not handled by other objects in the application. \n\nYou should use the macro IMPLEMENT_APP(appClass) in your application implementation file to tell wxWidgets how to create an instance of your application class.\n\nUse DECLARE_APP(appClass) in a header file if you want the wxGetApp function (which returns a reference to your application object) to be visible to other files.
