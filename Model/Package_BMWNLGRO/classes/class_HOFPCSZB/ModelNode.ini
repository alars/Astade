Description=wxString is a class representing a character string. Please see the wxString overview for more information about it. As explained there, wxString implements about 90% of methods of the std::string class (iterators are not supported, nor all methods which use them). These standard functions are not documented in this manual so please see the STL documentation. The behaviour of all these functions is identical to the behaviour described there (except that wxString is sensitive to null character).\n\nYou may notice that wxString sometimes has many functions which do the same thing like, for example, Length(), Len() and length() which all return the string length. In all cases of such duplication the std::string-compatible method (length() in this case, always the lowercase version) should be used as it will ensure smoother transition to std::string when wxWidgets starts using it instead of wxString.
